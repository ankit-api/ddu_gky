            Dear Sir,<br><br>
            As per reference cited above, we have been assigned a project to train rural youth in your state with the following district wise break up:<br><br>
            <table class="table table-bordered">
                <thead>
                    <th>S.No.</th>
                    <th>Name of the district</th>
                    <th>Target</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1</td>
                        <td>Ankit Bisht</td>
                        <td>Gram Panchayat</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table><br>
            We have already submitted a prospective action plan for undertaking the tasks. In this regard, you are requested to provide us with the list of Gram Panchayats for mobilizing the candidates.<br><br>
            We look forward to your guidance and support in implementing the project.<br><br>
            Yours sincerely,<br><br>
